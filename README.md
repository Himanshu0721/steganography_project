# Python Image Steganography

This Python project implements image steganography, allowing you to encode and decode hidden messages within image files. Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. This program uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to manipulate image pixels for embedding and extracting hidden data.

## Features

- **Encode a Message:** Hide a secret message inside an image file. The program converts the message into binary form and modifies the image's pixel values to embed the message.
- **Decode a Message:** Extract the hidden message from an image file. The program reads the pixel values and reconstructs the hidden message.

## How It Works

1. **Encoding Process:**
   - The message is converted into an 8-bit binary format.
   - Each bit of the binary message is embedded into the least significant bit (LSB) of the image pixels.
   - The program stops encoding when the entire message has been embedded into the image.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - The program reads the LSBs of the image pixels to reconstruct the binary data.
   - The binary data is then converted back into the original message.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PIL (Pillow) library

You can install the Pillow library using pip:

```bash
pip install pillow
```

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-steganography.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd image-steganography
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python steganography.py
   ```

### Example

1. To **encode** a message into an image:
   - Input the name of the image file you want to use.
   - Enter the message you want to hide.
   - Provide a name for the new image file where the hidden message will be stored.

2. To **decode** a message from an image:
   - Input the name of the image file that contains the hidden message.
   - The program will display the decoded message.

## Notes

- Ensure that the image you use for encoding is large enough to accommodate the entire message.
- The program modifies the LSB of each pixel, so the changes are not noticeable to the human eye.
